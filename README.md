InfiniteMonkey
==============

This application simulates the Infinite Monkey theory (which states that a monkey, typing into infinity will eventually type a well known piece of literature) by creating sentence-like gibberish and finding english words.

Originally starting out as a fun side project, I continued to develop this program, making it faster and faster.
Currently the limiting factor is not its speed but in fact its memory usage. The speed can be made faster with threading, I would think but the memory usage is a bit more interesting of a problem.

I have reopened this project again because I'm taking a Data Algorithms course. I'd like to see if I can apply my new knowledge to improve the performance of this program.

In /bin you will find a jar file, which when run in commandline with java -jar IMT.jar will start the program. Otherwise in /src you can find the original class and java file which can be used to run from there.

Please note: this program [does not simulate any physical interaction that normal monkeys may have with a typewriter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#Real_monkeys).
